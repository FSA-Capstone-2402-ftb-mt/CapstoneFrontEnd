# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Game Build:
-user needs to be able to enter only one letter into each tile
-user needs to only be able to edit one row at a time. Also cannot move onto the next row before submitting the guess for the row before it
-

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
